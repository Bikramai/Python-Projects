# Python + Projects

# Python Projects feor Beginners

## Getting Started

In these projects. we are not just going to build some cool Python projects, we are going to dive deep into the process of thinking  like a programmer. 

Coding isn’t just about getting things to work, it is about understanding the problem, breaking it down and building solutions that are clean, maintainable and actually make sense.

Here, I will walk you through my entire problem solving process, from the initial idea to the final polished solution. 

By the end of these projects, we won’t have just cool projects under our belt, we will have the skills to tackle coding challenges with confidence and got write code that we can be proud of.

So, if we are ready to go beyond just coding and start thinking like a problem solver, let’s dive into Python projects for beginners.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Python
- Variables
- Functions
- File handling

### How to Take this course

<strong>Remember, this course isn’t about quick wins</string>, it’s about building a strong foundation in problem solving that will serve you throughout our career.

By the end of each project, we will not only have a working solution, but also a deep understanding of the logic and thought process behind it.
