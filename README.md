# Python + Projects

# Python Projects feor Beginners

## Getting Started

In these projects. we are not just going to build some cool Python projects, we are going to dive deep into the process of thinking  like a programmer. 

Coding isn’t just about getting things to work, it is about understanding the problem, breaking it down and building solutions that are clean, maintainable and actually make sense.

Here, I will walk you through my entire problem solving process, from the initial idea to the final polished solution. 

By the end of these projects, we won’t have just cool projects under our belt, we will have the skills to tackle coding challenges with confidence and got write code that we can be proud of.

So, if we are ready to go beyond just coding and start thinking like a problem solver, let’s dive into Python projects for beginners.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with Python
- Variables
- Functions
- File handling

### How to Take this course

<strong>Remember, this course isn’t about quick wins</string>, it’s about building a strong foundation in problem solving that will serve you throughout our career.

By the end of each project, we will not only have a working solution, but also a deep understanding of the logic and thought process behind it.

# Project-1: Dice Rolling Game
- When we execute this program, first, we get question, roll the dice. In this program we have only two options,yes, or no. 
If we type anything else, we get an error message saying invalid choice. We can type y, eihter lowercase or uppercase, it doesn't matter. 
And every time we get two new random numbers, just like how we roll a doce. If we type n, our program terminates and displays a message saying thanks for playing.

# Project-2: Number Guessing Game
- Number Guessing Game - When we run our program, it generates a random number between 1 and 100 that we have to guess. 
Now if we type an invalid number like a,  we get an error message, and the program is giving us feedback, 
it says this is too high and too low. So the number that the computer has generated is between 5 and 10, 
try until we guess the number and display the message Congrations! You guessed the number.

# Project-2: Rock, Paper, Scissor
<p> Problem:
Rock, Paper, Scissor Game. How it works, First we get a question, rock, paper, or scissors.
Here we only have three choices, R, P, or S. If we type anuthin else, we get an error message saying invalid choice. Now let me go with R, that is short for rock, so I chose rock, computer chose paper, and I lost. Now right after we get asked if we want to continue, let's try again, this time I'm going to go with scissors, so I chose scissors, computer chose paper, I won.If you want to stop type n, the game ends.
